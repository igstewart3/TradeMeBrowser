# TradeMeBrowser
App designed for browsing Trade Me.


Known bugs:

Changing orientation from portrait to landscape after viewing listings will cause a blank screen to be displayed.

Viewing an empty category will sometimes leave all listings blank until the application is restarted.


Future Improvements:

Adjust UI to better handle split view controller across all devices. Currently some compromises are made between collapsed
and non-collapsed split views.
